This program was completed using pair programming. 
Partner: Brandon Gomez (brlgomez@ucsc.edu) 
Partner: Antony Robbins (androbbi@ucsc.edu) 

We acknowledge that each partner in a programming pair should 
drive roughly 50% of the time the pair is working together, and 
at most 25% of an individuals effort for an assignment should 
be spent working alone. Any work done by a solitary programmer 
must be reviewed by the partner. The object is to work 
together, learning from each other, not to divide the work into 
two pieces with each partner working on a different piece.
      
Brandon Gomez spent 0 hours working alone.
Antony Robbins spent 0 hours working alone.

Brandon Gomez spent 10 hours driving.
